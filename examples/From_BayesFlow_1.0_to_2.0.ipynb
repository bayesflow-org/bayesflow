Users familiar with the previous Quickstart guide will notice that it follows a similar structure, but assumes that users are already familiar with bayesflow. So we omit many of the the mathematical explaination in favor of demonstrating the differences in workflow. For a more detailed explaination of any of the bayesflow framework, users should read, for example, the linear regresion example notebook. \n",
