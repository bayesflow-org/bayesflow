# User Guide

**Attention**: This guide is in a very early stage, and for now mostly copies what you can also find in the {doc}`../examples`.
We plan to evolve this into a more comprehensive user guide, with more detailed information on each topic.
If you want to contribute, feel free to open an issue or a pull request, we welcome contributions to the documentation.
