# Developer Documentation

**Attention:** You are looking BayesFlow's developer documentation, which is
aimed at people who want to extend or improve BayesFlow. For user documentation,
please refer to the {doc}`../examples` and the {doc}`../api/bayesflow`.

This section is work in progress, so if you read through the code base and
encounter something that looks odd, but shows up in multiple places, please open
an issue so that we can add it here. Also, if you introduce a new pattern that
others will have to use in the future as well, please document it here, along
with some background information on why it is necessary and how to use it in
practice.
