## Citing BayesFlow

You can cite BayesFlow along the lines of:

- We approximated the posterior using neural posterior estimation (NPE) with learned summary statistics (Radev et al., 2020), as implemented in the BayesFlow framework for amortized Bayesian inference (Radev et al., 2023a).
- We approximated the likelihood using neural likelihood estimation (NLE) without hand-crafted summary statistics (Papamakarios et al., 2019), leveraging its implementation in BayesFlow for efficient and flexible inference.
